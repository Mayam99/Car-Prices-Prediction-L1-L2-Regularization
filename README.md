# Car-Prices-Prediction-L1-L2-Regularization

The Car-Prices-Prediction dataset from Kaggle is designed to help users build models that can accurately predict the prices of cars based on various features. This dataset typically includes attributes like car model, brand, year of manufacture, engine type, fuel type, mileage, horsepower, and other key factors influencing car pricing. The primary goal is to analyze these features and develop a model that estimates the price of a car given the input data.

Detailed Introduction for the Dataset
The Car-Prices-Prediction dataset consists of various features that impact the market value of vehicles. The dataset includes information on:

* Make and Model: Identifying the brand and model of the car.
* Year: The year the car was manufactured.
* Mileage (KM or Miles driven): The total distance the car has traveled.
* Engine Specifications: Details like engine size, type (petrol/diesel), and horsepower.
* Transmission Type: Whether the car has manual or automatic transmission.
* Fuel Type: Petrol, diesel, electric, or hybrid fuel options.
* Condition and Age: Older cars typically depreciate in value.
* Additional Features: Extras like leather seats, sunroof, and technology upgrades.

These features combined form a rich dataset suitable for regression analysis. The goal is to predict the car price (target variable) based on these input features.

Moving Forward with L1 and L2 Regularization

In this context, the focus is on applying L1 and L2 regularization techniques to improve model performance, particularly in the presence of multicollinearity or irrelevant features. Here’s a recommended approach:

1. Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)

Perform detailed EDA to understand the dataset, including:

* Checking for missing values.
* Visualizing relationships between features and the target variable.
* Identifying potential outliers.
* Analyzing feature correlations.

2. Data Preprocessing

* Handle missing values, if any.
* Encode categorical variables using methods like One-Hot Encoding.
* Scale features using standardization or normalization to prepare the data for regularization techniques

3. Modeling with Regularization

* L1 Regularization (Lasso Regression): Focuses on reducing the number of features by applying a penalty equal to the absolute value of the coefficients. It can effectively reduce less important features to zero, thus performing feature selection.
* L2 Regularization (Ridge Regression): Applies a penalty equal to the square of the magnitude of coefficients. It’s useful for shrinking coefficients, helping to deal with multicollinearity and improving model generalization.

4. Implementing and Tuning Models

* Split the data into training and testing sets.
* Fit both Lasso and Ridge regression models.
* Use cross-validation to tune the regularization strength (alpha parameter).
* Compare model performance using metrics like RMSE, R², and MAE.

6. Evaluating and Interpreting Results

* Assess the performance of Lasso and Ridge models.
* Determine whether L1 or L2 regularization provides better results based on your objectives (e.g., feature selection vs. handling multicollinearity).
* Interpret the coefficients and understand how regularization affects feature importance.

This structured approach allows you to leverage the strengths of L1 and L2 regularization, leading to a robust model that performs well on unseen data.
